# citrahost
Baby's first bash script. Makes a public Citra netplay server so you can play 3DS games online with your friends.

See the comments in the file for specifics if you need them, the script isn't that complicated though.

Issues and PRs related to the script (especially on any style or standards issues) are welcome.
